In his wake was the blanketing of the land in snow, and thus it is said that Greatfather Winter would cast his wintry veil over the land.  Though parts of Azeroth may lie in snow, it gives the land time for rebirth and renewal.', 2573),
(2573, 'The Dwarves$B$BEver consumed with the research of their origins, the dwarves choose to celebrate the season as a recognition of Greatfather Winter himself.  They consider him to be the personification of one of the ancients of Azeroth - the titans.  Much as they claim lineage in one degree or another to these mystical beings, they consider their snowy home of Dun Morogh as the prime example of Greatfather Winter\'s blessings.', 2574),

They focus almost entirely on the renewing aspects of the lore however, leaving legend worship to those races (as they view it) less in tune with the nature of things.  Many tauren choose this time as the right time to give thanks for the blessings of their new home in Mulgore.', 2575),
(2575, 'Feasting$B$BThe idea of feasting during this time of year is one that traces its origins to the legend itself.  As Greatfather Winter walked Azeroth, bringing winter in his wake, it is said he would provide a bounty for those who welcomed his presence.  As such, the idea of feasting during the Winter Veil would bring together communities as they shared whatever they had.  Typically, a single day of merriment and feasting welcomed the change, all in anticipation of the land\'s renewal.', 2576),
(2576, 'Modern Day Observation$B$BOther cultures have begun to recognize the Feast of Winter Veil as a time of great celebration, though not in the same traditions as the legend bases it in.  Customs, often unrelated to anything other than a chance for celebration and gift exchange, have made their way into modern day observation of the season.  Even the image of Greatfather Winter is sometimes used, but more as a harbinger of commercial exploit rather than as a supernatural titan.', 0),

The flight from Blackrock Spire was chaotic, to say the least. Unfortunately along the way, Mor somehow lost his footing, though I suspect that he was pushed. In any case, he fell down in to the recesses of the lower portion of the spire.', 2864),
(2864, 'MOR GRAYHOOF, continued...$B$BLater, we discovered that Mor had actually survived the fall. But there was to be no happy ending for my good friend; he was taken prisoner by the trolls of Tazz\'Alaor. Not long after, as he was being tortured by War Master Voone, a group of Valthalak\'s assassins jumped in and finished the job.$B$BShould you seek to raise the echo of Mor Grayhoof\'s spirit, War Master Voone\'s chamber is a haunted location.', 2865),
(2865, 'JARIEN AND SOTHOS$B$BSiblings and would-be members of the Scarlet Crusade$B$BJarien and Sothos were two of the most intolerant people that I knew. Yet their skills as combatants were exceptional, and they came from money, which I suppose is why Anthion, the leader of The Veiled Blade, kept them on.$B$BThe siblings eventually found themselves enamored with the teachings and philosophy of the Scarlet Crusade. They had always exhibited a certain zeal in vanquishing any of the Scourge that we ran across in our travels, and it was suspected that their family had ties to the organization.', 2866),
(2866, 'JARIEN AND SOTHOS, continued...$B$BSo it was that they found themselves facing the trials that are required of those that seek to join the Crusade. Of particular interest to them was a position of knighthood within the ranks; something that required more difficult testing apparently. For it was later discovered that Sothos actually failed his final test. Jarien would not have it though, and in open defiance she insisted that he be able to join her amongst the knights. From what we have gathered, Grand Crusader Dathrohan slew them both right on the spot in the middle of his chambers.$B$BThus it is that another of these haunted loci is The Crimson Throne inside The Scarlet Bastion at Stratholme.', 2867),
(2867, 'KORMOK$B$BTwo-Headed Ogre Necromancer$B$BWhat can be said about Kormok? He was a two-headed ogre of the caster variety who didn\'t used to be all that bad. When we first took him into the fold it was as a prisoner on some job we\'d accepted in Burning Steppes. He proved himself invaluable in helping us to get out of a sticky situation we fell into there, however, and so he came on as one of the company\'s premier mages.$B$BThe odd thing about him though was the completely different nature of his two heads. One was always cheerful if not a little foolish, while the other was sly, calculating and had an almost dead look to its eyes. Kind of creepy really.', 2868),
(2868, 'KORMOK, continued...$B$BLater, through the course of our travels, Kormok became exposed to the necromantic side of magic. Unfortunately the creepy head exhibited an affinity for raising dead spirits, and took a perverse pleasure in it, especially in summoning forth the exiled spirits of Purgation Isle to do his bidding.$B$BAfter the company disbanded, Kormok enrolled at the Scholomance to further his \'education\'. The spectral assassins found entrance to the school all too easy, and slew him right there in front of his new master, Ras Frostwhisper.$B$BThis makes Ras Frostwhisper\'s chamber one of the haunted locations where the brazier can be successfully utilized.', 2869),
(2869, 'LORD VALTHALAK$B$BDraconid Noble and former General of Blackrock Spire$B$BBefore General Drakkisath, there was Lord Valthalak, a draconid warlock of immense power. It is common for the leadership of the Spire to change hands, and unfortunately for us, we were going to play a part in the latest shift in power.$B$BWe\'d been commissioned by a goblin smuggler-wizard out of Booty Bay, Gremnik Rizzlesprang, to steal Valthalak\'s spellbook. We don\'t know if he wanted to study it or sell it (or both), and it doesn\'t matter now. What does matter is that we infiltrated the upper reaches of Blackrock Spire and slew Lord Valthalak in his lair. That\'s when the fun really began.', 2870),
(2870, 'LORD VALTHALAK, continued...$B$BWe had no idea of the depths of Valthalak\'s magical knowledge where soul-manipulation was concerned, or we probably would never have taken on the job in the first place. But take it we did, and it proved to be the last job we ever would take.$B$BHaving slain Lord Valthalak, and taken his spellbook, Kormok must have sensed something about his amulet. He insisted on taking it as his share of the loot, which quickly devolved into a heated argument, and almost a fight, over the thing. We didn\'t know at the time that the amulet actually housed a good portion of Valthalak\'s spirit; we found that out later, much to our displeasure.', 2871),
(2871, 'LORD VALTHALAK, continued...$B$BSplitting the amulet into pieces, we fled from the newly risen ghost of Valthalak, as well his army of spectral assassins. And the noise we made fighting over the amulet had roused a number of the Spire\'s remaining defenders!$B$BAlmost all of us made it out of Blackrock and thought we were safe. But, even from the beyond, Valthalak sent his minions at us no matter where we hid. The Veiled Blade soon broke apart after that mission, and then we were really easy pickings.$B$BAs you must know, this makes Lord Valthalak\'s abode, what is now The Beast\'s chamber in Blackrock Spire, the last of the haunted locations.', 0),

As for the original inhabitants, only time can tell that tale.', 2947),
(2947, 'For this expedition I have assembled Ajeck Rouack and Sir S. J Erlgadin, along with my trusted servant, Barnil Stonepot. I fought alongside Ajeck\'s father\'s side in many battles in defense of the Alliance. Seeing her grown is quite special. Her father schooled her well in the ways of weaponry. Her skills with a bow make me wonder if there is elven blood running through those veins.', 2948),

The purpose of this story is not to act as a political treatise or a biography. This is the account of my experiences hunting big game in the green hills of Stranglethorn....', 2950),
(2950, 'We rose with the sun. Barnil began to prepare the morning meal. I noticed Ajeck\'s attention was somewhat distracted. The day\'s trek would be long and our hunt would bring us close to danger. A lack of focus could easily lead to an errant mishap. Yet Ajeck seemed unable to divert her gaze from Barnil who stood by the edge of the river rinsing out his mess kit.', 2951),
(2951, 'Just as I was about to question Ajeck\'s lack of interest in the day\'s hunting strategy, she reached for her quiver, drew an arrow and unleashed a shot right towards poor Barnil. But it was not Barnil that Ajeck was shooting at. For when Barnil stepped aside, mouth agape, a large river crocilisk floated to the surface with Ajeck\'s arrow perfectly placed between his two large eyes.', 2952),
(2952, 'We set out toward the west, through the thick overgrowth of the tangled jungle. Moving with slow, deliberate steps we paced through thick foliage in search of prey. The morning passed in frustrated silence. Nothing was stirring in the Vale, not even a breeze. By the afternoon, the expedition had grown restless. Barnil no longer strode with the cautious steps of a predator tracking prey. Rather he clumsily clomped along the path often stepping noisily on dried leaves or fallen branches.', 2953),
(2953, 'During one such misstep, Erlgadin laid a heavy hand on Barnil\'s shoulder. Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness. Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree. Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.', 2954),
(2954, 'The beast was a male Stranglethorn Tiger. Before I could cock my rifle, Erlgadin raised his crossbow and fired upon the beast. The bolt missed its mark and caught the beast heavily in the left flank. The tiger made a futile attempt to flee but its wound was too grave. The beast stumbled for a few tragic seconds until Barnil finished the kill with a thrown axe.', 2955),

(2956, 'On a rocky precipice above, silhouetted by the setting sun, I could make out the largest cat of prey I have ever laid eyes upon. I was able to loose one clumsy volley with my rifle, but the cat held his ground. He growled once again, this time louder than the first, and vanished.\n\nWe gathered our belongings and headed solemnly back to camp.', 2957),
(2957, 'I had promised the expedition that we would spend the next day hunting panthers, as their furs are in high demand throughout Azeroth.

(2958, 'Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin were anxious to learn how to hunt effectively with a Dwarven Rifle. I had the two humans leave their primitive range weapons at base camp. Barnil and I outfitted them with some of Ironforge\'s finest firearms.', 2959),
(2959, 'On this day we ventured to the south, following some fresh panther tracks. Soon we reached a ravine spanned by a tremendous rope bridge. I could not help but to think of Brann\'s descriptive writings of this region when I saw the engineering marvel. So often it was assumed that the native Trolls were a primitive and uneducated race yet as I gazed upon the master craftsmanship of the bridge I was able to recognize the skill with which the Troll builders overcame the seemingly impossible feat.', 2960),
(2960, 'Before long, Ajeck tracked the panther to the southwest. We walked quietly, guns at the ready, in anticipation of our prey. A snapping of twigs from a nearby copse of trees drew our attention immediately. Something was in there. One stern glance at Barnil was enough to convey my thoughts. Barnil slowly lowered his rifle. This kill was not for us; it was for our Human companions. Countless panthers had lost their lives in front of our smoking barrels. This kill would be for the Humans.', 2961),

A slow trickle of perspiration trailed down from Elrgadin\'s temple as he pulled the pin back. Upon the sound of the click, the thick flora parted and a large black panther -- a beautiful specimen -- darted out onto the plain.', 2962),
(2962, 'The Humans trained their sights on the panther as it ran along the edge of the tree line. The barrels of their guns moved in perfect parallel tandem. Barnil gave me an urging glance but I shook my head no. This hunt was for the Humans, not Barnil or me. Erlgadin fired a booming shot, missing the panther altogether. Apparently he was unprepared for the violent kickback of the rifle blast.', 2963),
(2963, 'His gun tossed back violently in his arms. The barrel swooped sideways and came up beneath Ajeck\'s rifle. Ajeck had chosen that exact moment to pull her trigger. The rifle, the aim now knocked clumsily toward the tree line, went off with a distinct boom. A flock of birds screamed out of the canopy, scattering in every direction. A plume of smoke rose from the tree. We watched in awe as a tremendous branch fell squarely on the fleeing panther, breaking its back', 2964),
(2964, 'As the weeks passed our stockpile of panther and tiger skins grew immense. I decided it was time for the expedition to shift our focus to a new challenge: Raptors.\n\nThe Humans, while appreciative of the training Barnil and I offered, decided to refrain from hunting with firearms. Ajeck was much more comfortable with a finely strung bow and Sir Erlgadin never left camp without his sturdy crossbow.', 2965),
(2965, 'We set out at first light, heading south past the Tkashi Ruins. Barnil voiced concern that we might encounter members of the Bloodscalp Tribe. I reminded Barnil that the Bloodscalps were more concerned with destroying their tribal enemy, the Skullsplitters. Needless to say, Barnil was not comforted in the least. I, however, had a loaded rifle, a satchel full of gunpowder and three deadly hunters with me to ease any concerns of an unfriendly ambush.', 2966),

An unruly band of Trolls seems as harmless as a jackrabbit in the hills of Dun Morogh.\n\nWe passed the Tkashi Ruins without event, much to Barnil\'s relief. The party proceeded to head westward, toward the Great Sea, skirting the Ruins of Zul\'Kunda just to the south. As we ascended the high sea bluffs we spotted our first Raptor.', 2967),
(2967, 'The beast never so much as detected our presence. In fact, the only greeting he received from the expedition was a bullet between the eyes.\n\nSir Erlgadin let out a hearty *hurrah* as Ajeck nodded toward me with keen approval. I sifted through my pack in search of my pipe, hoping to enjoy a celebratory smoke. Barnil began to scurry up the hillside to retrieve the Raptor\'s corpse. I stared at the fallen beast with the satisfaction that accompanies every big kill.', 2968),
(2968, 'But I could not bask in the glory of the kill for long. For when I turned my eyes toward the horizon, several silhouettes appeared cresting the hill, just above poor Barnil.\n\n*Flee, Barnil!* I shouted. Ajeck, Sir Erlgadin and myself loosed a volley of bullets, arrows and bolts over Barnil and toward the pursuing raptors. One of us landed a kill amidst the confusion.', 2969),
(2969, 'Our hastily aimed shots were enough to buy Barnil\'s escape. Barnil clamored back down the hill and rejoined the party. We scurried off into the jungle; a pack of ferocious Lashtail Raptors stalking our every move. \n\nThe hunters were now the hunted.', 2970),
(2970, 'I led the party toward the sea, hoping the shoreline would provide refuge from the Raptors. In our haste we had drifted too far north, to a precariously high elevation. The mistake was made. The fault was mine. We stopped just short of a sheer cliff, the Raptors just a few paces behind.', 2971),
(2971, 'I stepped slowly forward, gun raised. I had led these brave hunters to their death. I would die defending them. Lashtail Raptors are particularly fierce, known for their unrelenting blood-thirst. They far outnumbered us. But I would be damned if I let them kill me and my comrades without shedding some of their own blood first.', 2972),
(2972, 'Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin readied their weapons, flanking me on either side, our backs to the sea. Barnil let out a defeated sigh and drew his axe. The Lashtails were almost upon us. Their steady stride had slowed. They were stalking their prey now for they knew they had us trapped.', 2973),
(2973, 'And then something miraculous happened. From off to our side we heard the distinct and terrifying roar of the great white tiger. Despite their numbers, the Raptors turned and scattered in all directions. We saw but a brief white flash as the tiger darted past us and pounced on one of the Raptors. No command needed to be given. All four members of our party knew it was time to run.', 2974),
(2974, 'We sprinted all the way back to base camp, never slowing. Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate. Such are the risks of the big game hunter. We toy with fate by delivering it. Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate\'s razor sharp teeth.
