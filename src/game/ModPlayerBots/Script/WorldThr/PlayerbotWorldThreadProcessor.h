/**
 * @brief Processes thread-unsafe bot operations in the world thread
 *
 * The PlayerbotWorldThreadProcessor manages a queue of operations that must be executed
 * in the world thread rather than map threads. This ensures thread safety for operations
 * like group modifications, LFG, guilds, battlegrounds, etc.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Map threads queue operations via QueueOperation()
 * - World thread processes operations via Update() (called from WorldScript::OnUpdate)
 * - Operations are processed in priority order
 * - Thread-safe queue protected by mutex
 *
 * Usage:
 *   auto op = std::make_unique<MyOperation>(botGuid, params);
 *   PlayerbotWorldThreadProcessor::instance().QueueOperation(std::move(op));
